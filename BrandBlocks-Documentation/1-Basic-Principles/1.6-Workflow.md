![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

All new pages and changes/edits that are published have to go through a Workflow. The workflow means that published changes are put into a task list and will need to be approved. Only after approval they will appear on the Public Web.

*To approve a change or new entry for publication onto the Public Web open the respective task via double-clicking. Then you have to assign this task to yourself via `Assign to me` and publish it via `Approve & publish`.*
