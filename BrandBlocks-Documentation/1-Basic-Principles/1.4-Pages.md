*In the area `Pages` one gets an overview with regards to the structure of the MediaNet (information architecture).*

The first level corresponds to the start/home page of the Brand Net portal. The following levels can be defined as MediaNet Contentpage or as a Redirect. The navigation structure of the MediaNet is identical to the page structure of the Admin Central.
In the features area on the right, all possible features and functionalities are shown, such as `+ Add page`.

**The Working Area contains five columns:**
-	Page: unique technical name of each individual web page
-	Title: title of the individual web pages – corresponds to the main title of the page.
-	Template: description of the used Template (MediaNet Contentpage Home or Redirect)
-	Status: shows the status of the respective page, e.g. published, deactivated, etc.
-	Modification date: shows the date of the last change of the page

On the right-hand side you can find the features list for Pages, which contains the most important feature symbols. The features menu can alternatively also be opened via right-clickin on the Page column.
