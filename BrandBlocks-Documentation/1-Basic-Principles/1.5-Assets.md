*All images and documents, that can appear as content (also multiple times) or downloads on the portal, are stored here.*

Also here the feature area is on the right-hand side, showing all features that are available for the assets. The available features vary depending on the selection of either an Asset or a Folder. Via right-clicking one can also open the features menu directly from the asset.
