## 4.2 Publish Asset Dependencies

Please be aware that when you publish a page, the system does not automatically publish the underlying assets (e.g. images) that are displayed on this page. For that you need to publish the assets separately. Assets are published via the `Assets` App, where you can publish an individual or multiple assets in the same way as you publish pages in Magnolia.

However, you can always check for each page if the assets on it are published in the background already. This you can do via the `Edit Page Properties` function on a page, and then go to the tab called `Dependencies`.

There it displays the status of the assets and if they are published. If you want to access a specific asset, you can simply click on this asset and are automatically taken to the Assets app, where you can publish or unpublish the asset.
