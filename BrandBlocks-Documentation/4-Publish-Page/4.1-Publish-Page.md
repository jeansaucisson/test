## 4.1 Publish Page

To publish a new or edited page it can be selected in the work area `Pages` and then via the button `Publish` it goes into the publication workflow. Also here you can alternatively open the available features via right-clicking on the page and select the Publish function from there. It is worth noting that there is also an option to `Publish incl. subpages` if one wants to publish the changes of the subpages at the same time.
Please be aware that all Magnolia editors are able to trigger the publication workflow, but only the admin users (i.e. the core branding team that is part of the `publishers` group) is able to publish the pages in the workflow.
