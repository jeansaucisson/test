## 2.2 Content filling at the example of the „Text Image“ Component


Via the `Plus Sign` in the content area you can add new content elements as shown above. This can happen on any page, always at the bottom of that page.

Choose the desired content Component called Text Image. This is the most commonly used Component for adding content to a page.

Fill in the content such as the Subheading and the Text.

*This text can contain plain text, can include different stylings based on the editor (such as title and header stylings, highlighted text, bold or italic text, etc.)*

You can also set links within the Content Editor directly, by pressing the Link button above the editor. This creates a normal link within the text.

You can also choose to have a link open in a new modal window/light box, which you can do via the `Advanced` Tab in the Link option. There you have to set Stylesheet Classes as `js-bmlink` in order to have the link open in a modal window.
