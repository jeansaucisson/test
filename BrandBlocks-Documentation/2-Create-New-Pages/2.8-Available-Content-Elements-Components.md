## 2.8 Available Content Elements & Components

While the Text Image component is the most used one, there are many other components that you can choose when adding content or features to a page in Magnolia. This is a list of available Content Elements and available Components to choose from that are in use at Credit Suisse.

### Intro Area

The Intro Area is the first title area of a content page. The title used in the intro area is automatically shown in the left-hand side navigation on the top level. This display in the side navigation can be disabled if required via `Edit page properties` and ticking the box `Hide in Navigation`.

### Section Title

Section Titles are simple title elements that are important to define the title and anchor points in the left-hand navigation as defined above.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The title itself can be named as required via editing the component.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Accordion

The option to display and hide content by opening/closing a box via the shown arrows.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

To add an accordion you can add a component to the page via `Add component`.  You get to the menu displayed below, in which you can choose the accordion.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In a second step you can add the Name and Title of the accordion. The Title field is the one that will be displayed on the page.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The result of creating this component is an accordion that can then be filled with other accordion elements via add `new content component`.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

When clicking on the plus for `accordionitems` and then `new content component`, you can create new accordion elements/sections that can be filled with more components and content later on.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Via clicking on `new content component` within a section, you can add additional content, in most cases this will be `text image` content within an accordion.

### Color Palettes (Swatches)

The Color Palettes component is used to display different colours in a graphically appealing palette view with the individual colours and related information displayed as round dots / circles.

When adding color swatches in the Color Palettes component, you can define a title for the color palette and then add color swatches via either defining PMS, CMYK, RGB or HEX values or otherwise by assigning a correct path to the color swatches stored in the Magnolia CMS.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Via clicking ADD, one will be redirected to the `Color Swatches` area of Magnolia and can select the desired color swatch accordingly.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In this magnolia color swatch menu you can add additional color swatches via the `Add color swatch` function on the right hand side.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

There you can enter a name for the color swatch and the values that should be displayed as well as the color itself via hexadecimal values. The Image function in this menu would overwrite the color definition accordingly, so either choose the definition or the image to define the color.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Slider

The Slider component is used to display large images and slider elements across the entire page, for example on the home page or on specific content pages where such a slider element can be used as a nice visual intro to the page (or of course within the text itself).

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

For the slider you can select to display the dots, auto play the different slider items, set the speed transition (i.e how quickly the items change in msec), and a slider timeout (i.e. how long it waits to display the next slider item in msec).

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

There are several styles, a standard / hero style (large, for the full width of the page) and a gallery style (smaller images).

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Once you choose the desired style you can then add a Slider Item to the slides in order to define the text and/or images for the slider.

Please note that if there are display problems with the slides, please try ticking the box `Use additional Figure-Element around Images`. This often solves the display issues.

### Carousel

You can set up a Carousel to display various media assets within a simple carousel view as shown below.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The assets displayed within the carousel can be shown dynamically, i.e. if new assets are uploaded to the system matching the criteria of the carousel filter, these are automatically displayed within the carousel. The criteria for the assets are chosen via defining a SmartLink in the Main options.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The parameters, i.e. filter criteria, can be selected in this window via the `Add` button in the Parameters. Important is to select Parameter `Creative view` to Value `false`. This is required in order for the SmartLink to work.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In the Global Search parameter, you can also work with operators such as `AND` or `OR` or “`-`“ in order to create more complex parameter filter.

### BM Download Link List

Via the BM Download Link List you can define download links as shown below.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In the options `Main` tab of the BM Download Link List you can set the title, text, and most importantly the Media Pool ID related to the asset that should be available for download.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

You can select the Media via the Select Media picker button, if you don’t know the ID, and a window will pop up showing you the available media

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In addition, the display of this component is managed via the `Display` tab. You can always only choose to display one button, i.e. only tick one of the available buttons. You can also select alternative icons via the Select New buttons of the according icon to be chosen.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Icon Download Link List

The Icon Download Links List is a special option available in the BM Download Link List component in order to display the download with available icons within Magnolia.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

You can set the title, text, and link for the download and also select a specific Icon in the Icon field.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

You can change the Icon Color here as well in the accordingly named field, so that it looks like the following sample.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Use the Icon Color field for the definition of the desired color.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Tab List

Option to switch from content to content via horizontal tabs. These tabs can be used when content is clearly separated for two or more categories, topics, etc. A good example at Credit Suisse is when guidelines are separate for Print and Digital, then a tab for each of these areas might make sense.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

`Edit Mode:`
![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Column Components (Two Columns, Three Columns, Four Columns)

The Column components allow you to add content to a page across a specific number of columns. When you want to add a new column component to a page, choose which number of columns you require when adding the component (two, three, or four columns):

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The following example shows a setup of a three column component to display a list of Don’ts within the guidelines.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In order to fill the columns with text and images, you need to add a `Callout` within the desired Content Column item:

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The Callout provides you with the option to add an icon (from the assets in Magnolia or from the Icon Library), the required text within the column, and an image.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

The following example shows the use of the two column layout, which might make more sense when displaying information that requires some spacing in-between and if you have a total number of items that is even. It can also be used to display graphs in columns as shown further below.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

`Chart Example:`
![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Teaser List

Option to create a tile structure to provide various topics. This can be with or without an image. This is useful as an additional navigation element beside the top navigation on the page, and in case one wants to create clear sub-pages instead of putting all text on one long content page.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

`Edit Mode:`
![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Text Image

This is the most commonly used component that contains text and images, and an option to add legends to the images. Importantly, it can also be used within Accordions and Tab Lists.

Please also refer to the previous pages about the text image component regarding how to apply this component.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

`Edit Mode:`
![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Text Image Components are also often used within other components that allow for text and images to be added within them (Accordion, Tabs, Columns.

In this example a Text Image Component was used within an Accordion.

`Edit Mode:`
![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Separator

Option to separate content with additional space or a separation line.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

`Edit Mode:`
![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

### Grid System

You also have the option to use a `Grid System` in the various tab of the component menu. The grid on the pages always consist of 12 virtual columns. This allows you to use components for only specific parts of a page width, e.g. if you want one component to be 1/6 of a page, and another next to it 5/6.

In order to apply the grid to components, you first need to create a grid system by adding the grid component.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Within the grid system I can then use any other component, via adding components through the typical `+` sign.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

For each component that I add in the grid system, you can go to the Various tab and select the number of columns (i.e. the width) you would like to apply for that specific component.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

Please be aware that if you have activated the sida navigation, this already occupies three columns of the 12, i.e. you only have 9 available for placing the components on a page where the side navigation is used.

Also, you need to make sure you place the right components per line, it does not automatically break for multi-line (fluid) setups.
