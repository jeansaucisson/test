If you want to set page that is only being a redirect to one of its sub pages, ensure that when you add a new page in Magnolia you choose the `Template` option `Redirect` as shown below.

During the next step of adding a page you get the option to define if the page should be shown in the top navigation of the portal (you can `Hide in Navigation` by pressing the according tickbox) and if this page should be used as the `Subnavigation-Start-Level`, i.e. displayed as the start/top level of the sub navigation.
