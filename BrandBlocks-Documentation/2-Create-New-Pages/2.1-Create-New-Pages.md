## 2.1 Create New Pages


Change to the working area `Pages`. Via clicking on `Add page` in the features menu you can create a new page. If a page needs to be created on the first level, no page in the Page Column should be selected. When creating pages on lower levels (from level 2 on) the respective higher level page has to be selected first via clicking on it.
