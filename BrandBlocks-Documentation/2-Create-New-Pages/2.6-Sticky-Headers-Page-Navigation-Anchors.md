## 2.6 Sticky Headers, Page Navigation (Side navigation) and Anchors

The pages have the option to display a sticky title on the top, and this can be displayed for the various sub-pages as well (such as the Brand Basics sticky title in the screenshot below, which will always stick to the top of the page when scrolling).

The sticky title can be added to a content page, i.e. when you create a page make sure that the MediaNet Content Page template is applied.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

On the top of the page you see an area called `Stage` and this is where you can add a sticky title.

When you add a component in the `Stage` area you can choose the `Sticky-Header-Title` type of component.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

When setting up the Sticky-Header-Title component, you can choose the Title you would like to have and also if the sticky header is inherited by its sub-pages. If this `Show in Subpage` box is unticked, then the sub-pages will not have the same sticky header.

Now you have set up a sticky title that will be displayed, and always stays on top of the page.

:warning: **Important Note:** If the parent page is should be a Redirect and contains a sticky title, then you need to follow a special process in order to make the sticky title work in combination with the redirect. You should first need to have a page with the template MediaNet Content Page (which is the parent page). Once you have created this, then add the sticky title and header information as defined above. Only after you have done all the sticky title setup, then you change the template to a Redirect page. See further below how the Redirect page is then setup.

### Sub-Pages and Side Navigation

When creating related or new sub-pages, you have the option to show a side navigation on the left-hand side for this specific page. This can be done via the `Edit Page properties` function on the page.

Within the Edit Page function, you can then define a `Navigation Title` and tick the box `Show Sub-Navigation` in order to choose to display the left-hand navigation on the page. You can also choose to hide this page in the left-hand navigation by ticking the box `Hide in Navigation`.

### Grouping of Sub-Navigations

There is the option to group side navigation items/points into various groupings with a line indicating the group name.

In order to create such groups, you need to create fictitious pages for the group name / title. These fictitious pages need to have the `Sub Navigation Type` of `Parent` selected in the page properties. And the sub-pages within a group need to have the Sub Navigation Type of Child.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

You will see the Sub Navigation Type of the page in the page overview in a separate column.

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

I.e. there are different types of Sub-Navigation in the drop-down: Child (which means this page will be a child item in the side navigation), Parent (which means this page will be a parent item in the side navigation) and Standard (which will place the page on the general level of the navigation, when sub-navigations are not used). Standard is the most commonly used option.

### Anchors

The side navigation can also display anchors within a single page. These are displayed under the page title on the left-hand side navigation (as shown by the Palettes, Examples, and Don’ts in the screenshot below).

The way you can create these anchors for a page is by using the `Section Title` component to add a section title and then setting the correct settings via `Edit component`

![alt text](../reference/dummy.png "this is a placeholder")

In the Section Title edit window you need to choose the tickbox `Add anchor to the side navigation` in order to make this section title visible as an anchor on the left-hand side navigation.
