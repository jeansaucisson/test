## 6.1 Asset Search Page

The asset search page is a key element in the Credit Suisse Brand Net in order for the users to have a simple asset search and filtering functionality on a separate page. The asset search page consists of several tabs and has check boxes / drop downs that represent the filter criteria for the respective search area.

The configuration of the asset search page, i.e. the faceted search, provides different options for Title, Auto-Triggering of the Search, and List Display (instead of tiles) in the main window.

You can also define the drill-down option related to the theme tree (i.e. the theme tree defined in the BrandMaker Media Pool) on the Theme tab.

And lastly you decide which filters are shown on the specific asset search page. Again, these filters are coming from the asset type defined in the BrandMaker Media Pool.
