The top of the BrandNet page displays a search button.

There is a possibility to configure the search flyout buttons for the search, via editing the Start Page / Home Page. I.e. you need to go to Edit Page of the Start Page to access these settings.

On the tab `Site Search` you have to set the site search settings such as where the search results are displayed (i.e. on which `Search Page`), the Search Button Text that is displayed next to the search, and the button list title that is displayed to the left of the Search Buttons. Here you can also enable the Asset Search so that the system also searches Magnolia Assets rather than just the content of the portal. Furthermore, you can limit the type of files in here via defining the Asset Search Extensions.

You can set the `List of Buttons` in the bottom part of the configuration tab. You can add an unlimited number of buttons here. Every button needs a Button Label, a Target Page (within the portal), and also a URL-Parameter (e.g. the specific tab index of a specific page, i.e. to jump to a specific tab on a page rather than just the page).
