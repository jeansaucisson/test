## 6.8 Disclaimer

The portal has a special disclaimer / waiver component that is defined via a special waiver page.  This page always needs to be called waiver in the system in order for the waiver to be displayed to users that login for a first time. The actual page needs to have a `Disclaimer component`  in order for this to work properly.

When you go to the `Disclaimer component` option and the tab with the same name, you need to set a target page in `Select Page` options field.

This target page chosen here needs to be the Redirect type of page, through which the SSO is initiated, i.e. this is crucial for it to work properly. In the rest of the fields in the `Disclaimer tab` you can set the texts and checkboxes (incl. button text) for the disclaimer page.
