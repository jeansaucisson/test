## 6.5	Icons

The various icons that can be used across different components (in the BM Download Link List, Icon Download Link, Carousel, Callout, Faceted Search) are defined in the separate Magnolia module called `Icons`. This is accessible via the app launcher on the top of the screen.

All the icons from your icon collections are available through this Icons application, which has been uploaded into the backend of the system. See below a sample of the icons from the portal styleguide.

If you want to extend the icon library, you need to go into the Icons App and either `Add Icon` or edit an existing one. There you get options such as Icon Title, Icon ID, CSS Class, Keywords, etc. Important is that the ID of the icon in Magnolia matches the ID of the icon in the portal styleguide.
