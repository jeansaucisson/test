## 6.4 Site Search Assets (Full Text search for Assets)

In order to be able to also search through the assets in the system via the full text / site search, one needs to activate this option in the `Edit Page Properties` of the Home page. There you can find a tick box called `Asset-Search enabled` in order to activate this feature.

In order to restrict the file types that are searched for, you can type in the extensions of the types that should be searched in the `Asset-Search Extension` field. Enter the values separated with commas in order for it to work.

If this field is left empty, then all assets are searched for in the full text / site search.
